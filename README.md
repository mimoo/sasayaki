# Sasayaki (SSYK)

## Wishlist

* `.disco/` folder with all the info    
    - everything there is encrypted?
* yubikey/U2F needed to use the chat?
    - does that only protects signing on?
    - or it could be used to start the application /recover with an encrypted backup we store
    - this allows us to onboard people/
